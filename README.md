# Turtle crossing
Get to the other side of the screen, but avoid the cars along the way!

## Project description
The user is able to control the turtle that appears on the bottom of the screen, by using the 'up' key on their keyboard. They have to get to the top of the screen, without hitting the moving cars! Once they reach the finish line, the difficulty will increase. Hitting a car will result in a game over.
